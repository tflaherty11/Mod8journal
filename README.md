ProjTwo Dash

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  - The CRUD Python module is a universally applicable method as this type of program is used all over the computer industry.
  - The create, read, update and delete functions are within every sophisticated database in the world, learning how this component of computer science functions with a programming language was an excellent way to have my learning experience come full circle.
     
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  - Problem solving is very similar in many fields, I currently work in business management that forces me into problem-solving situations on a daily basis.
  - In the computer world, errors are inevitable. I tend to create programs intermittently and attempt to visualize what I am looking for from my program. If I run into an issue, I will remove code blocks until I identify the issue. A lot of problem solving also exists within the knowledge of multiple techniques in your field of expertise. Having more than one solution is critical to getting the answer you are looking for.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  - Computer scientists are responsible for engineering efficiency and creating more than one solution to the industry's problems.
  - My work on this project could help Grazioso Salvare to better serve their customers by giving them this visual representation of their company's services. This functionality may also inspire further creative displays of functionality from the inner contributors of this company.
